A job is what a player asks the robot to do. This will be top level wrapper around a given task and may give the player behaviour choices on how it is completed.

When a robot is undertaking a task it will use multiple actions and sub tasks autonomously to complete the task. Tasks can take time and may include searches of the map in a time distributed fashion.

Actions are things where the robot interacts directly with the world. They are done instantly and managed by a task. The master's name will be used as the player for all actions (ensures events are raised and so the correct player can be blamed).

Actions are:
    - Walking - LuaControl.walking_state
    - Driving - LuaControl.riding_state
    - Riding a train - give train a path and set off
    - Crafting - LuaControl.begin_crafting
    - Building - LuaSurface.create_entity (building from cursor is a LuaPlayer function)
    - Mining - LuaControl.mine_entity (have to wait the mining time as this will appear instant)
    - Upgrading - LuaSurface.create_entity (with fast_replace true)
    - Move items between chest and robot - LuaInventory.insert and LuaInventory.remove
    - Shooting - LuaControl.shooting_state (can target a position and then shoot nearest enemies or shoot at the ground)
    - Repairing - LuaControl.repair_state
    - Rotate entity - LuaEntity.rotate

Behaviours are related to the job and may dictate the action chosen or the choices made during the task decision process.

Tasks can contain other tasks. I.e. "build this blueprint" includes the tasks of obtaining a list of required materials, collecting or crafting them, moving there and placing the entities.

Tasks can be interrupted and will need to have a persisted state. When resumed the task will need to re-validate itself and confirm its current progress in the task is still accurate. Possibly returning to previously completed sub tasks and repeating their investigations and checking steps.

Tasks and Actions should register their calling function by name in to MOD.Interfaces. Then the Jobs/Tasks can store the name in their data to be save/load safe.

    - Scan area for ghosted items
    - Craft required items (manage the actions)

    - Complete ghosts (includes build, mining, upgrading, rotating, etc):
        - Scan area for ghosted items (if not passed in)
        - Move to location
        - Do action (build, mining, upgrading, rotating, etc)
