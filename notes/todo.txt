flesh out a basic job and task structure that is save/load safe and stores very basic data.
flesh out simple mod upgrade process to handle when the mod is upgraded and jobs need to be re-evaluated.


Future things to cover:
    - Forces being deleted and merged. We cache them in Robot.
    - Robot entities dying, we need to update our cache of them and track their corpses.
    - At present we only support 1 robot per job as the task list is under the job. The task list should likely have a per robot element with some sort of sharing between the robots, i.e. if building a ghost they ned to not both bring the same start of the items list.


Feature Enhancements:
    - Walking a path:
        - Detect railway and either try to path around or stop just before it, look both ways and then cross when safe. If not safe for X time place a signal and wire it up to be red, then cross safely.
    - Robot personalisation:
        - Robot name: Allow for a generic server name list (mod setting) and also each player to be able to rename their robots individually.
        - Robot color: Allow players to set a color per robot.
        - Show the robots as colored dots on the map. I don't think I can make the names appear on the map and thus can't honour the Show Players option on the map (and minimap) view.
