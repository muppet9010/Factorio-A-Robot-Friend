flesh out a basic job and task structure that is save/load safe and stores very basic data.
flesh out simple mod upgrade process to handle when the mod is upgraded and jobs need to be re-evaluated.


Future things to cover:
    - Forces being deleted and merged. We cache them in Robot.
    - Robot entities dying, we need to update our cache of them and track their corpses.
